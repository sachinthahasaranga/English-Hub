      'Recent advances in language acquisition emphasize the critical role of listening skills in second language learning. Traditional, one-size-fits-all approaches often fail to meet diverse learner needs, leading to disengagement and uneven progress. Modern educational technologies, especially AI-driven adaptive systems, have demonstrated effectiveness in personalizing listening practice by dynamically adjusting task difficulty and providing real-time, semantic feedback. Research highlights the importance of integrating both bottom-up and top-down listening strategies, cultural context, and metacognitive development to enhance comprehension. However, despite successes in STEM EdTech, language learning particularly listening comprehension remains underfunded and underserved. Existing platforms often lack real-time adaptability, personalized feedback, and long-term skill tracking. Emerging AI-powered solutions using machine learning models and predictive analytics show promise for bridging these gaps by delivering tailored, engaging, and culturally contextualized listening experiences that foster autonomous language development.',

      'Students aged 10–12 often struggle with listening comprehension due to generic, non-adaptive educational platforms that lack personalization, emotional awareness, and predictive capabilities. Traditional systems follow fixed learning paths and respond only after failure occurs, limiting engagement and learning outcomes. Moreover, they rarely adapt in real time to a learner’s emotional state or academic progression. The proposed solution, EnglishHub, is an intelligent, web-based learning platform that integrates machine learning, real-time emotional feedback, and adaptive gamification to enhance English listening comprehension. By combining student classification, LSTM-based performance forecasting, and dynamic content adjustment, EnglishHub offers personalized listening activities tailored to each learner’s skill level and emotional engagement. Through interactive narratives, affect-aware mini-games, and scaffolded sessions, EnglishHub transforms listening practice into a responsive, engaging, and effective learning journey—bridging critical gaps in current language education tools.',

      'The study developed an adaptive learning platform for students aged 10–12, integrating machine learning models to personalize listening comprehension activities. Student data and responses were collected via a web-based MERN stack application, with Python Flask hosting ML models for real time evaluation using a cosine similarity algorithm. Two learning modes—Main and Practice Sessions were designed, with dynamic content delivery based on proficiency levels stored in MongoDB. Emotional states were captured through real time facial expression recognition using TensorFlow and OpenCV to inform adaptive storytelling and activity difficulty adjustments. A secure dashboard provided progress reporting for educators and parents. The system’s architecture emphasized scalability, responsiveness, and child-friendly UI design, with plans for extended features like speech recognition and advanced analytics.',

                      Current popular language learning platforms primarily focus on general language skills like vocabulary and grammar but lack dedicated, structured listening comprehension development. They do not adequately support advanced listening sub-skills such as inference-making, note-taking, or academic listening, which are essential for real-world communication and academic success.

                      While some platforms include basic adaptive features, they rarely offer real-time, granular content adjustment based on learner performance. Personalized feedback targeting specific listening skills and dynamic difficulty scaling during activities are largely absent, limiting effective individualized learning paths.

                      Many existing systems fail to incorporate proven educational frameworks such as Mastery Learning, Cognitive Load Theory, and Scaffolded Learning. This results in static, one-size-fits-all content that does not optimize cognitive capacity or progression within learners’ Zones of Proximal Development.

                      There is a notable deficiency in real-time emotional recognition and affective feedback integration in language learning platforms. Existing tools either use post-session self-reports or offer simplistic mood indicators, missing opportunities for in the moment adaptive interventions that can mitigate frustration or disengagement.

                      Current solutions focus primarily on academic metrics, neglecting detailed emotional engagement data and long-term skill development tracking. Predictive forecasting of learner trajectories and early intervention mechanisms are rarely implemented, reducing timely support effectiveness.

                      The deployment of biometric and emotional data tracking technologies in child-focused education remains limited by privacy, security, and regulatory concerns. This hinders widespread adoption and research into real-time adaptive learning based on affective states.
